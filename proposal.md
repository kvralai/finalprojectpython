# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

TODO

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A discord bot that completely randomizes a user with someone whose interests are completely different from user's.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

A bot will ask set of different questions, from "what is your favorite color?" to "do you like anime?"

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Rida Ayub - rida.ayub@temple.edu
Alex Thomer - tuk29043@temple.edu

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The good outcome is that the bot will work without any bugs and create the chat.
We will accomplish at least the starting point, which is questionaire.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The better outcome is the chat will ask all the questions and will be able to process them.
I think the bot will be able to process questions.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome is the bot will work without any bug, questions in chat will successfully ask the user, the bot will able to process them and successfully categorize them,and at the end will able to match the user with the complete opposite stranger.
We really hope our project will work.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

First, we will research on discord bots and how to create them. We will research on what more we have to learn in python to successfully complete th project. We still did not asign to each other any roles.
